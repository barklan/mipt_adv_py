**Object-oriented programming ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming))** 

- Languages that support object-oriented programming (OOP) typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts:

 - Classes – the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions
 - **Objects** – instances of classes

Objects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as "circle", "square", "menu". An online shopping system might have objects such as "shopping cart", "customer", and "product".[7] Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric. 

- In object-oriented programming (OOP), **encapsulation** refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.[1] Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class (so-called "getters" and "setters") to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.
- In programming languages and type theory, **polymorphism** is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.
- In object-oriented programming, **inheritance** is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance, a "child object", acquires all the properties and behaviors of the "parent object" , with the exception of: constructors, destructor, overloaded operators and friend functions of the base class.
